# Advent of Code 2023 ðŸŒŸ

Hey!

These are my attempts at solving the problems of this year. In here, I will be only using Java, but I may do a separate repo for a C or Rust alternative.

## Day 1: Trebuchet?!

What a good problem to warm up! I have yet to crack a more efficient way to convert the words in each of the lines, but I am pretty happy with the solution.
Let's hope this year I have enough time to implement some kind of chart to make runtime more visual.

## Day 2: Cube Conundrum

Interesting day. I managed to join the easy and hard solutions, so it is pretty fast, but the first takes more time. I plan to add more comments to the code, so if I ever read it I remember what it does.
### EUREKA! The chart is a work in progress!

## Day 3: Gear Ratios

Back on track with the problems! After this **big** break, I'm full of energy, and most importantly, ideas! This day was simple, but I made a mistake on the coordinates' labeling, and this led to a hard-to-find issue. However, it was nothing that some thorough debugging couldn't fix.

## Day 4: Scratchcards

Fun day, with an interesting hard solution that uses **dynamic programming** to optimize the cards' copies counting. My approach has been using *HashMap* due to the useful *getOrDefault* method, but it could've been done using a simple array or *ArrayList*.

## TBD...

Let's see what comes next!
